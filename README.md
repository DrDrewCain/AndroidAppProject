# AndroidAppProject

I created an app for a school project which utilized gradle and android studio. The following compromised of all that I have learned throughout the course Software Methodology (213) at Rutgers University under the teaching of Professor Lily Chang. I learned greatly about the different ways to write my code more efficiently and concisely readable. Making the readability fairly easy on the eye as well as spotting bugs easier. I used the MVC model to develop the app. I worked on this project with another individual my classmate whom I worked with throughout the semester.

Some things that I wish I could have done better is to switch the algorithm around, I felt that I could have made the app much better and include more functionalitys for example adding a more complex database such that when an individual orders from the app users would receive a text notification that their order has been made. As well as allow a functionality which sends users receipts of their order via email. I would like to improve how I remove a pizza from the menu as well as change the overall design of the app such that it is more pleasing to the eyes. Overall, I felt that I learned much about OOP, the software methodologies techniques such as the MVC and MVP design model that is widely used in the industry.
